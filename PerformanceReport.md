# ‚û°Ô∏è No Optimizations (Release Mode)

### üìä Metrics
- **Average FPS:** 135  
- **Average Frame Time:** 7.1 ms  
- **Average CPU Usage:** 6.3%  
- **Average Memory Usage:** 64.6 MB  
- **Average GPU Usage:** 16%  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remarks:  
- Sometimes the FPS drops to an AVG of 75 and FrameTime goes up to 12ms

# ‚û°Ô∏è Chunking Optimization (Release Mode)  
> Note that I also added a `Scene` class in which I have a `chunks` vector that contains all the chunks that need to be drawn on the screen.  
> I also added some other modularization like `processes`, `windowing`, and `initialization`, etc.  
> Meaning, CPU time may increase.

### üìä Metrics
- **Average FPS:** 145  
- **Average Frame Time:** 6.7 ms  
- **Average CPU Usage:** 3.0%  
- **Average Memory Usage:** 36.0 MB  
- **Average GPU Usage:** 15%  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remarks:  
1. The GPU usage spikes to **98% to 100%** a lot of times for some **fucking reason**.  
   - This didn‚Äôt happen previously ‚Äî only after this optimization. 
   - This happens in both **Debug** and **Release** modes.  

2. I noticed some **Spike Downs** in FPS too (**10 to 50 FPS**) and **Spike Ups** in FrameTime (**25ms to 30ms**).  
   - This happens **more** in Debug Mode.
